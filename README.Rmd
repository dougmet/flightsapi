This is a proof of concept for running R-based web APIs from plumber. There are two main components to the project:

1. R package: Containing package code and separate api endpoints (in inst directory).
2. `Dockerfile`: An image, based on the [plumber](https://github.com/dougmet/docker-plumber) image that installs the package and starts the plumber process.

An example of a website using the API is at: [dougashton.net/flightsapi](http://www.dougashton.net/flightsapi/). For now the API isn't well documented. And isn't on at all...

There's a simple GET endpoint that I use to test it's working at https://api.dougashton.net/pb/hols/now
